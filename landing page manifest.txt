Concise Headlines — 
we want our main headline on top of our landing page to directly convey our mission, vision, purpose in the best 
way possible. Be bold about the usefulness of your product.

Call-to-Action — 
our call to action buttons should be easy to spot, and with inviting messages on their own. 
If you’re offering early access use “Get early access” and so on.

Email Singup Form — 
you want to make your email signup form visible, but not too bloated with text or other funky widgets. 
Traditional email input form and the “Subscribe” button work the best.

Photo & Video — 
enriching your landing pages with great visual content is invaluable to your success. 
Investing in professional photographers and videographers is a must if no one else on the team is able to produce 
high-quality visual content. A demo video helps to ingrain your mission as well as set the tone.

Social Proof — 
have any publications written about you in the past? Use it to your advantage as social proof, it’s one of the 
easiest methods of ensuring that your visitors feel safe about using your product.

Urgency (optional) — 
sometimes it helps to mention things like the availability of the product, mostly if you are 
still in a development phase and currently work just with BETA testers and such.
